# ReportBug
This is a plugin for the esoTalk forum software, what it does is very simple, it creates a footer option called "Report Bug", this plugin is very simple and shouldn't really need to be edited unless you wish for something more "flashy".

Install to >your directory>addons>plugin then unzip and this is the very important part rename the plugin ReportBug (Normally Github adds "-master" in the plugin's name which will make the plugin unusable.
